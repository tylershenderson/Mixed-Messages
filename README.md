## This is my Portfolio project for Codecademy
### Mixed Messages (26% through full stack course)
+ Goal: This is indended to create a random message or greeting that seems realistic, and has many variations.
+ My code: This code should output a string with 3750 variations

Example "Ciao! I'm currently taking a break and stretching my legs, and I'm feeling a bit anxious about the upcoming deadline. It's 
early evening, with the sun beginning to set, and the weather is raining heavily with thunderstorms in the area! Ciao ciao!"
